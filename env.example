# Yahoo Fantasy Sports API Credentials
# 
# To get these credentials:
# 1. Go to https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/
# 2. Create a new application
# 3. Copy your Client ID (Consumer Key) and Client Secret
# 4. Set redirect URI to match your local setup:
#    - HTTP: http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback
#    - HTTPS: https://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback
#
# NOTE: For production, use server-side environment variables (without NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
# and handle token exchange on the backend to keep client_secret secure.

NEXT_PUBLIC_YAHOO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Server-side only (for production)
# YAHOO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
# YAHOO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
